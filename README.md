# Story-Telling

### The Moth 
> <p> My absolute favorite. a compilation of stories from themes story telling nights and events all over the world. </p> 
### 99pi

### Ear Hustle
> <p> another radiolab podcast, this one isnt recorded in oakland, but across the bay in san quentin prisons. a really unique insight into the life of inmates, whose stories are oft overlooked</p>

# Explanatory
### How I Built This With Guy Raz
> <p> guy raz talks with founders of companies, movements, ideas. its great and humbling, and an amazing insight. and he ends each episode with the same question: is your success based on your skills/ability, or luck? most interesting question</p> p
### Planet Money
> <p>econ for dummies, and the great things is that they go over recent events all the time (trade war anyone?) </p> 
### Stuff You Should Know
> <p> 2 guys just talking, and bringing in experts to talk about random things. josh and chuck are pretty funny. sometimes they get derailed, and it can get annoying, but i guess it has its appeal </p> 
### Freakonomics Radio
> <p> one of the authors of the freakanomics book, stephen dubner just tackles random/fun problems. similiar to planet money  </p>

# Cooking 
### The Splendid Table
> <p> favorite food podcast. the recipes are like stories, literally leaves my mouth watering all the time. and some awesome tips </p> 
### Cooking Issues
> <p> talk show format, dave arnold is super informed about food science (both actual food and food tech). he takes questions from callers and answers them. reminds me off a cooking version of *Car Talk* </p>
